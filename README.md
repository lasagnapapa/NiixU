### NiixU custom firmware for the Nintendo Wii U

This CFW allows for function with Aroma plugins as well as Legacy applications (ELF)
A complicated venture I started so that applications like HID to VPAD and TCPGecko can still be used alongside Aroma plugins.

Support for this CFW is limited to myself and associates at this moment in time,
these files require my private decryption key. For those interested PM on Discord (lasagnapapa)

This also requires the utilization of a custom PCB mod-chip I developed for my own personal Wii U,
as well as for a few of my friends who I play online with through the Pretendo Network.
The gerber file for the PCB is private as well, as I have no intentions of broadening this project.
This CFW will remain available and updated on GitHub for those limited users,
and these notes will provide useful for them as well as I update the firmware for us.

Note: To use Nintendont, or launch GameCube games from TeconMoon's WiiVC Injector, you must use "Nixtendont"
It is a custom version of Nintendont that allows it to function while running NiixU, as the legacy executions cause issues with some apps (mainly those running through the vWii).

The files for this can be found here https://github.com/lasagnapapa/nixtendont/releases

The password for it can be found in our Discord server in #niixu-starterpack underneath the "NiixU" category.
